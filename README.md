# Digit-Recognition-Gradio
 handwritten digit recognition system using TensorFlow and Gradio. It loads a pre-trained model to predict handwritten digits drawn on a canvas. The TensorFlow model is based on a convolutional neural network (CNN) trained on the MNIST dataset. Gradio is used to create a user-friendly interface for drawing digits and getting real-time predictions. The code allows users to experience the model's inference capabilities interactively.
